brief.js
========

Small (~4k minified, ~1.6k gzipped) library used for DOM Selection and Event Listening.

```
// add a click listener to body that delegates to all the anchor tags.
brief('body').on('click', function(event) {
  // code to run
}, 'a');
```

Why!?!?
=======

I wanted to make an incredibly lightweight, focused library that does what it does well. I don't want it to have frivilous extras. I also didn't want to force developers into directly using my DOM selection API. 

brief.js allows you to use both its DOM Selection API and Event Listening API seemlessly together or completely apart.

A lot of libraries out there have API that allow DOM Selection and event listening. But most of them also are incredibly large and require you to use both the selection and event listening api. I don't want to force you into that.

the brief function
==================

The brief function takes in a ```selector``` and an optional ```context```. This function will get all the elements that match the selector that is passed in and return a brief object.

the brief. methods
==================

There are three methods that you are able to call without envoking the actual brief function: ```.on```, ```.onAll```, ```.once```, ```.onceAll```, ```.off``` and ```offAll```.

These functions are the same functions that are called on brief objects, however the element(s) that you are trying to add event listeners to must be passed as the first argument.

This means that while we do make our DOM Selection API available to you, you aren't being forced to use it! If you want to use the regular ```document.getElementById('id')``` and then pass that in, you can:

```
var elem = document.getElementById('id');
brief.on(elem, 'click', callback);

// or

var elems = document.getElementsByClass('class');
brief.on(elems, 'click', callback);
```

brief objects
=============

brief objects are array-like objects that are created when using brief.js. These objects hold elements and provide several methods to interact with them:

```splice```, ```push```, ```pop```, ```toArray```, ```empty```, ```filter```, ```indexOf```, ```get```, ```find```, ```forEach```, ```getOffsets```, ```on```, ```onAll```, ```once```, ```onceAll```, ```off``` and ```offAll```.

splice, push, and pop are the original array methods applied to the brief object.

toArray turns the current brief object into an array of the elements that are contained in it.

empty removes all elements from the object

filter takes a filter function or a string selector and removes all elements that don't match

indexOf takes in a selector and looks for an element that matches that selector.

get takes in an index and returns the element at that position.

find takes in a selector and queries for elements within the context

forEach takes the current brief object and iterates over it with a traditional for loop (since forEach loops are so slow...), calling the passed callback for each item

getOffsets gets the offsets (top/left) of the elements in the brief object. If there are 0 elements in the brief object, it returns null. If there is one, it returns an object with a top and left property. If there are multiple elements in the brief object, it will return an array of objects with top and left properties.

on takes four arguemnts (two required and two optional). it takes in an event type, a callback, and one of both of the following: a delegation selector and/or whether to automatically remove the listener after the first call and adds event listeners.

onAll takes in an array of event types and defers to the on method.

once is a convenience method that applies the .on method with the last parameter as true.

onceAll is a convenience method that applies the .onAll method with the last parameter as true

off takes in an event type, a callback and (optional) delegation selector and removes the event listeners.

offAll takes an array of event types and defers to the off method.


Browser Support
===============

IE9+ and any modern browser.

We need to support 

```
addEventListener
```

```
querySelectorAll
```

```
matchesSelector // or one of it's prefixed verisons
```


Usage
=====

brief.js will use the brief function to grab elements and return them as an array-like brief object.

With this object you will be able to add event listeners, remove event listeners, iterate over the elements and search for child elements.

The ```.on``` method accepts 4 arguments. ```type```, ```callback```, ```[delegatee]``` and ```[autoRemove]```.

The ```.on``` method is chainable. It will return the Element or NodeList that it was called on.

The first two arguments are required and the last 2 are optional.

type can be a string. It represents an event type

callback must be a function. It will be passed an event object

The first optional argument is used if you want to delegate the event. This argument can be any CSS selector. This can be completely ignored if you don't want to delegate the event, or if you only want to use the last argument.

The last last optional argument can be used if you want to remove the event listener after the first time that it is called. However, a convenience method is added for you ```.once``` so that you can avoid using this altogether.


Grabbing Elements
=================

You can use brief to grab elements easily. You can pass in a selector (required) and a context (optional). The selector must be a string, however, the context can be a string or a brief object.

```
var elements = brief('#id > .class');
var element = brief('#id');
```

Any of these will return brief objects.


Non-delegation example
======================

```
brief('#id').on('click', function(event) {
  // code to run on click
});
```

You can also chain!

```
brief('#id').on('mouseover', function(event) {
  // code to run on mouseover
}).on('click', function(event) {
  // code to run on click
});
```

And it supports multiple event listener types for one function!

```
brief('#id').on('mouseenter mouseleave', function(event) {
  // code to run on mouseenter and mouseleave
});

// or

brief('#id').on(['mouseenter', 'mouseleave'], function(event) {
  // code to run on mouseenter and mouseleave
});
```

You can also add event listeners that only need to be run once!

```
brief('#id').once('click', function(event) {
  // code to run once on click
});
```

Delegation example
==================

```
brief('body').on('click', function(event) {
  // code to run on click if the element is an anchor tag
}, 'a');
```

You can chain these too!

```
brief('body').on('click', function(event) {
  // code to run on click if the element is an anchor tag
}, 'a').on('mouseover', function(event) {
  // code to run on mouseover if the element is an anchor tag
}, 'a');
```

You can run it on multiple event listeners too!

```
brief('body').on('mouseenter mouseleave', function(event) {
  // code to run on mouseenter and mouseleave of an anchor element
}, 'a');
```

You can run these once too!

```
brief('body').once('click', function(event) {
  //code to run once with the delegated listener
}, 'a');
```

Remove Event Listeners
======================

If you want to remove event listeners, you must have a reference to the function that you passed into the ```on``` method.

```
function handler(event) {
  // code
}
brief('#test').on('click', handler);
brief('#test').off('click', handler);
```

This also works for delegated listeners:

```
function handler(event) {
  // code
}

brief('body').on('click', handler, 'a');
brief('body').off('click', handler, 'a');
```
